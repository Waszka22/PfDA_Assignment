# PfDA_Assignment

## Introduction

This repository is used for the project given by the lecture on Programming for Data Analysis module on  <em><strong>Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics at ATU</strong></em>. This repository contains the Jupyter notebook <code>PfDA_Assigment.ipynb</code> and data files. 


### Problem Statement

For this project you must create a data set by simulating a real-world phenomenon of
your choosing. You may pick any phenomenon you wish – you might pick one that is
of interest to you in your personal or professional life. Then, rather than collect data
related to the phenomenon, you should model and synthesise such data using Python.
We suggest you use the numpy.random package for this purpose.
Specifically, in this project you should:

+ Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could
   collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables.
+ Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their
   relationships with each other.
+ Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
+ Detail your research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the
  data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
